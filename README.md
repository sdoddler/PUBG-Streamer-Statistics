# PUBG Streamer Statistics
A Simple program written in Autoit to pull data on PUBG Players &amp; their statistics. This will mostly be useful for Streamers or people that run Twitch.tv Chat bots as it saves the information to .txt files.
Currently the refresh interval is hardcoded at 5 minutes as PUBG.ME does not regularly update their stats & to reduce strain on their website.

The program currently pulls data from PUBG.ME as there is currently a lack of offical API to gather stats from.
